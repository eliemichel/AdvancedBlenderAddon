Advanced Blender Add-on
=======================

Many great examples are provided as Python templates in Blender, but none of them illustrates of to organize files to write an add-on of more than a single file.

This repository intends to give a **starter kit** as well as to illustrate and intensively comment **design patterns** commonly used in advanced Blender add-ons. It also gives in the comments pointers to related documentation.

Feedback
--------

**Feel free to suggest or request new examples.** I'll happily make this as exhaustive as possible so that it becomes a reference for add-on developers.

Feedback can be given through [issues](https://github.com/eliemichel/AdvancedBlenderAddon/issues), the [BlenderArtists thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/wip-advanced-blender-addon-starter-kit/1253453) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/exppad).

Usage
-----

You can download this repo as a zip and install it as a Blender add-on. Then it features **hot reloading** so you can go to where the add-on is installed (e.g. `C:\Users\Elie\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.90\scripts\addons` or `.blender/2.90/scripts/addons`), modify the files and run "Reload Scripts" in Blender to update the add-on without restarting Blender.
